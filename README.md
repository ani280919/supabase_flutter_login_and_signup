# supabase_flutter_login_and_signup_using_magic_link

This Flutter Project allows users to Login and Signup using Supabase as a backend. It would check if the user is new or existing and then would redirect them to the respective page - login or signup.

1. This Flutter code defines a SplashPage widget, which is typically used as a splash screen for an application. The purpose of the SplashPage is to quickly determine whether the user is already authenticated and, based on that, redirect them to either the account page or the login page.
2. This Flutter code defines a LoginPage widget, which is responsible for handling user authentication using a magic link sent via email.
3. This Flutter code defines an AccountPage widget, which represents a user profile page. Users can view and update their profile information on this page. The page interacts with Supabase for authentication and accessing user profile data.
